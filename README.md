# Predict-house-prices
Project: Predict House Prices Using Linear Regression

We will:

Generate synthetic house price data.
Implement Linear Regression with Gradient Descent.
Train the model and visualize the loss.


How It Works
Generate Synthetic Data for house sizes and prices.
Normalize Data for better gradient descent performance.
Define Cost Function and Prediction Function.
Implement Gradient Descent to optimize model parameters.
Train the Model and Print Optimized Parameters.
Plot Cost Function Convergence to visualize learning.
Plot Regression Line to see the final model.
Just copy and run this script in Python, and it will train a simple linear regression model using Gradient Descent
